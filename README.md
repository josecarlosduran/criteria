## Install the project


1. Clone your project
3. Move to the project directory: `cd your-project-name`
4. If you don't have it already, [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
5. Install the project dependencies: `composer install`
6. Run all the checks: `composer test`. This will do some checks that you can perform with isolated commands: 
    1. [PHP Style Check](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer): `composer style`. If you want to fix style issues automatically: `composer fix-style`.
    2. [PHP Unit](https://phpunit.de/): `composer phpunit`.
